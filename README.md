# taxi-fare-prediction
Accurately estimating taxi fares is an important problem for many parties, including ride-sharing platforms, passengers, and taxi firms. It facilitates the efficient management of fleet operations, driver route optimization, and fare predictions for clients. In this project, we want to use the Random Forest algorithm to create a predictive model that will estimate the taxi fare based on a number of variables, including the time of day, passenger count, pickup and dropoff locations, and trip distance.

Collection
We make use of a fake dataset that mimics taxi fare information. The following features are present in the dataset:

fare_amount: The destination variable's total fare for the journey.
trip_distance: The total distance traveled on the journey.
passenger_count: The total amount of travelers.
pickup_longitude and pickup_latitude: The pickup location's GPS coordinates.
dropoff_longitude and dropoff_latitude: The dropoff location's GPS coordinates.
pickup_datetime: The commencement date and time of the journey.

Let's proceed with the complete workflow:

Import Libraries
Load Dataset
Explore and Preprocess the Data
Split the Data
Train the Random Forest Model
Make Predictions
Evaluate the Model
Plot Actual vs Predicted Prices
